Some things to be aware of:

1] This code was all produced and tested on a debian based linux distribution. 
If you have any rpoblems running it please let me know and I can arrange to demo 
it for you on this platform. I assume the code will compile under Mac OS since 
they both use the POSIX environment

2] Some issue with the graphical runtime on this linux machine keeps giving me an 
intermittant segmentation fault

"Feb 27 18:20:58 Iridium kernel: [ 3108.914945] ChatAppGNUstep[3803]: 
segfault at 968 ip 00007ffe31ded6ca sp 00007ffe2e2d9960 error 4 in 
libX11.so.6.3.0[7ffe31dc3000+133000]"

I have been unable to correct the issue and assume it is due to the gnustep runtime on this machine?

3] The server operates on port 8550 by default
